 <h1>Internet Radio Clock</h1>
<p>This simple app just displays the clock and has 3 buttons associated each with a radio stream and came from the desire to be able to see the clock in  my kithcen and listen to the Radio Guerrilla morning show at a touch of a button, while living abroad. :)</p>
<p>Out of the box it comes configured with Radio Guerrilla and Tananana from Romania and RadioBOB from Germany, because these were the radios that I listened to the most. The streams are configurable from the settings section.</p>
<p>I tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you have any ideas or you think it can be improved, write me an email at cristi.ciuc@gmail.com</p>
<p>The code is opensource and it can be found on github: https://github.com/ciuc/InternetRadioClock</p>
